# Mission
To create an open-source platform that aggregates, cross-references, and analyzes public data (e.g., public contracts, bankruptcy filings, 
court rulings) to enhance transparency, support investigative efforts, and provide citizens with accessible insights into governance and 
public spending.

# Core Features
1. **Data Aggregation** – Collect, clean, and structure publicly available datasets.  
2. **Search & Cross-Referencing** – Enable intuitive search and linking between related datasets.  
3. **Public & Open Access** – Ensure accessibility for journalists, researchers, and citizens.  
4. **Community Collaboration** – Allow contributions, discussions, and analysis.  
5. **Scalability & Resilience** – Design infrastructure to handle growth and potential resistance.  

# Planned Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) for API services, with room for Rust/Go where performance is critical.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS (if geospatial data is relevant).
- **Data Processing:** Celery (Python) for async tasks, Kafka for event-driven processing.
- **Search & Indexing:** OpenSearch/Elasticsearch for fast document queries.
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React) with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN for UI.
- **Infrastructure:** K8s + Docker + Cloudflare.  

# Why Contribute?
1. **Technical Challenge** – A meaningful open-source project that engages modern, industry-relevant tech.
2. **Civic Impact** – A tool that enhances government transparency and combats misinformation.
3. **Community Building** – A platform where Portuguese developers can contribute, learn, and showcase skills.
