## **1. Executive Summary**

This business plan outlines the development and sustainability of a crowdsourced, data-driven platform designed to combat misinformation, enhance political transparency, and provide a reliable source of information and discussion. The platform will empower citizens, journalists, and policymakers to access and analyze public datasets, contributing to a more informed democratic process. The project will initially launch in Portugal, with expansion planned to France and Germany, ultimately scaling to the European Union level. The platform will be fully independent while leveraging EU funding for development and access to public datasets.

## **2. Mission and Vision**

### **Mission**

To create a neutral, verifiable, and collaborative platform that empowers the public with fact-checked, data-driven insights, fostering community engagement and enabling better democratic participation and policy evaluation.

### **Vision**

To establish the most trusted and accessible political and civic information platform in Europe, fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making.

## **3. Market Analysis**

### **Problem Statement**

- Political misinformation and biased narratives distort public opinion.
- Lack of centralized, neutral, and fact-checked repositories of public data.
- Media and policymakers struggle to access structured, unbiased public sentiment.

### **Target Audience**

- **General Public**: Access to fact-checked reports and data.
- **Journalists & Media**: Real-time analytics and verified information.

3. **API Access Tiers**: Free tiers for low-volume users to encourage adoption, with paid tiers for high-volume users.
4. **Public Endowment Fund**: Long-term financial stability, with details on establishment and management.

## **6. Growth & Expansion Strategy**

1. **Phase 1 (2025-2026)**: Launch in Portugal with a pilot program for an engaged community.
2. **Phase 2 (2027-2028)**: Expansion to France, aligning with the 2027 elections, and securing EU partnerships.
3. **Phase 3 (2029-2030)**: Expansion to Germany, integrating advanced AI and automation tools.
4. **Phase 4 (2030+)**: Scale to full EU-level adoption, addressing challenges such as language support and regulatory compliance.

## **7. Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

### **Legal & Regulatory Risks**

- **Defamation & Legal Liability**: Implement strict moderation and verifiable sources, with legal consultation for compliance.
- **Data Privacy (GDPR Compliance)**: Ensure full anonymization and transparency.

### **Technical Risks**

- **Scalability Challenges**: Utilize k3s, distributed storage, and optimized queries, with backup and disaster recovery plans.
- **Platform Manipulation & Bias Risks**: Implement reputation-based weighting for contributions.

### **Financial Risks**

- **Reliance on Donations**: Diversify revenue streams and establish contingency plans.

## **8. Conclusion & Next Steps**

This project has the potential to redefine how political information is verified and consumed in the European Union. With the right funding and technical execution, it can serve as a guardian of truth, empowering both citizens and policymakers with reliable, unbiased, and data-backed insights. The next step is to secure initial funding and begin development in Portugal, with a roadmap to EU-wide expansion.

## **9. Technical Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure & Core Setup (Weeks 1-4)**

**Goal**: Establish a solid foundation with local k3s, CI/CD, observability, and data storage.

#### **Tasks**:

1. **Cluster & Storage Setup**
   - Set up k3s across the three laptops using Ansible for configuration management.
   - Configure persistent storage (local filesystem for now, keeping NFS in mind for future scalability).
   - Ensure cluster nodes are properly joined and communicating.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Deploy Gitea in k3s.
   - Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, ArgoCD).
   - Test and validate deployments.

3. **Observability & Monitoring**
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana.
   - Set up OpenTelemetry & Jaeger for distributed tracing.
   - Configure logging (Loki or Elastic if needed).

4. **Database & Metadata Layer**
   - Deploy Postgres in k3s with proper persistence.
   - Define schema for indexing dataset metadata.
